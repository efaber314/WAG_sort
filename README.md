# WAG_sort
This simple program takes a list of names from a specially formatted CSV and makes groups of 5 and names  leaders if there are any available. Outputs to a text file!

Spreadsheet organization:

Name,	pronouns,	Would you like to lead a group?, Do you prefer to meet in person or virtually?, What time of day do you prefer?, Do you have a specific writing goal?

After running this program manually match leaders with groups!!!
